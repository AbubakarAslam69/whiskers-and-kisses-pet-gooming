                            This package is a delightful way to treat your furry friend to some well-deserved pampering! Your cat will enjoy a soothing bath, followed by a 15 minute brush-out to leave their coat soft and tangle-free. We’ll also give their paws some love with a gentle nail trim for a complete, fresh look. We take extra care to make the experience as calm and loving as possible. However, depending on your kitty’s coat condition or behavior, additional charges may apply. Your cat will leave feeling refreshed, cuddly, and absolutely adored!
